Day -3 #Write a Python program that takes a student's marks in three subjects as input.
#If the average is greater than or equal to 90, print "Grade: A".
#If the average is between 80 and 89, print "Grade: B".
#If the average is between 70 and 79, print "Grade: C".
#Otherwise, print "Grade: Fail".

average = (marks1 + marks2 + marks3) / 3

if average >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif 80 <= average < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif 70 <= average < 80:

#Day-4
2.Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a given positive integer n

def even(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):
        total += i
    return total
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
if n > 0:
    result = even(n)
    print(f"The sum of all even numbers between 1 and {n} is: {result}")
else:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
